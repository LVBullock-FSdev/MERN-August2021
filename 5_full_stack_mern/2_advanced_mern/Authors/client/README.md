Authors Assignment - https://login.codingdojo.com/m/146/6961/50377

Objectives:

Create a full CRUD app with React, Express, Node, and MongoDB
Include backend validations
Create an application where users submit their favorite authors. List all the authors on the first page. From there, the user may click on a button to edit or delete each author.

The edit form must be pre-populated with the existing data for the author.

Use backend validations to ensure that all author names are at least three characters long. If the user does not pass validations, display an error message. Validations must also be applied when editing an author.

BONUS: If someone tries to navigate to the edit page with an unrecognized id, display an error message. For example, "We're sorry, but we could not find the author you are looking for. Would you like to add an author to our database?" Then, provide a link to take them to the form to create an author.

BONUS: Sort the authors alphabetically.

NOTE: The URLs in the wireframe below show port 8000, but this should be port 3000 when using React for the frontend

Create a page to show the list of all authors

Create a page to add a new author, which redirects back to the list page upon successful creation

When you delete an author, they should automatically disappear without a page refresh

By default, all validations should come from the backend server

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
